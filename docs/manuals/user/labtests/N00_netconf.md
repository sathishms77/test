# Netconf Tests

Test steps in this section serve the following purpose:

1. Deploys Netconf and its companion containers
2. Verifies base-line operation of Netconf Server
3. Introduces the tester to a subset of Netconf operations, which are
    * SSH connection 
    * Retrieve Voltha YANG modules
    * Initiate a GET command on a Voltha Instance
    * Retrieve the list of adapters

   Running these test cases will require a Netconf Browser.  The MG Soft 
   Netconf Browser will be used.  A free 30-day trial of that browser can be obtained from <http://www.mg-soft.com/download.html?product=netconfbrowser>.
