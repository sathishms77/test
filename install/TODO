- Create an installer tar file when not run in test mode
  - This file should include:
    - The qcow2 image for the installer
    - The KVM xml metadata for the installer
    - The private key to access the VM
    - The bootstrap script to launch the installer
  - In the future, it could include (which would make it 1 or 2G larger).
    - The .deb file to install vagrant
    - .vagrant.d directory with all the configs and boxes
- Clean up the ansible scripts
  - Create a cluster-host role
    - Install all dependent software using dpkg and pip
  - Move the pull and push roles into the voltha role
    - Use the target selector to trigger the appropriate ones
    - OR create voltha-deploy and voltha-create roles (TBD)
